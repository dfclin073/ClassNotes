### OPSEC ###

--data-length 30
Usually, Nmap transmits minimal packets consisting of a mere header. Hence, the TCP packers are commonly 40 bytes, and requests of ICMP echo are simply 28. The command is useful in circumstances where our target could consider a particular size of a packet to accept. The byte can be any size.

-f
The -f command induces our scan to deploy diminutive fragmented IP packets. Specifically, our command utilizes 16 bytes per fragment which diminishes the amount of fragments.  The logic behind our Nmap command is to divide the TCP header above numerous packets to render it increasingly difficult for packet filters, IDS, and additional security irritations.

-n
No DNS resolution

-Pn
Do not ping target, assume its up

--DON'T USE

-don't use -A
-don't use -sV
-don't use -O

### TUNNELING ###

--unprivileged
Assume the user lacks raw socket privileges

-sT

--proxies SOCKS://127.0.0.1:1080

--max-parallelism 1

if it hangs its because the ICMP filter response cannot get back through the tunnel


### ISSUES ###

hostname = Nmap
OS = Nmap
